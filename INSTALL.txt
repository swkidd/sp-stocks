INSTALLATION:
    To create an executable:

    Make sure 'pip' (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is installed on your system by opening a command prompt and typing:
        pip --version
    A version number should be printed out, if not go to the link above and install pip.

    A executable file can be created with 'pyinstaller'. From the project directory run:
        pip install pyinstaller
    Install all the necessary dependencies by running:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    then run 'install.py' to use 'pyinstaller' to create the executable.
        python3 install.py

    This will create a directory 'dist/' containing an executable file which will run the program.

    To run from a command line:

    Make sure 'pip' (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is installed on your system by opening a command prompt and typing:
        pip --version
    A version number should be printed out, if not go to the link above and install pip.

    Install all the necessary dependencies by running:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    then run the app with:
        python3 gui.py

    IMPORTANT:
        In order too run correctly the app requires icons and company data. The icons are found in './icons' and must be in
        the same folder as the executable. Company data is stored in 'snp_dict.pickle' and will be generated automatically if not found
        in the same folder as the executable. This will take a LONG time (~20+ minutes) however, so it is best to share the executable with
        a current version of 'snp_dict.pickle'.

        The may take several minutes to load if it has to pull a lot of data from the internet.
